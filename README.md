# vue-Vite_Pinia

This is a scalfold Vue project with Vue Router, Axios (for HTTP requests), Pinia (state management), and Vite (for fast builds), ESLint (linting), JWT Authentication, and Vite testing.

## Recommended IDE Setup

VS Code.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
